## Project2: Analyze A/B Test Results
### Introduction
For this project, we will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. Our goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
### Test Parts
#### Part I -  Probability
let's import our libraries and compute our numberes for the later parts
#### Part II - A/B Test
Now we run a hypothesis test continuously as each observation was observed. However, then the hard question is do we stop as soon as one page is considered significantly better than another or does it need to happen consistently for a certain amount of time? How long do you run to render a decision that neither page is better than another?These questions are the difficult parts associated with A/B tests in general.
#### Part III - A regression approach
 In this final part, we will see that the result we acheived in the previous A/B test can also be acheived by performing regression.
